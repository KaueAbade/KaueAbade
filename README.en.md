## Introduction

My name is Kauê Abade, I'm an engineering student and intern with a passion for turning my thinking into results through programming.


## How so?
For as long as I can remember, one of my greatest satisfactions has come from what I've described above, from the simplest things to the most complex.
The first piece of code I wrote had this satisfaction in mind, when I was 12 years old I wrote a roots calculator for quadratic functions in C++ (for positive deltas, of course) using my smartphone.
Looking back, it certainly wasn't a perfect code, but I'm glad I wrote it.


## My interests
I'm interested in C++ and C# development, with a basic knowledge of both languages.
Besides trying to improve myself in both languages, I've been studying to build simple front-ends in my applications.
Both in .NET forms in C# and in web development.


## Academic background
I'm currently studying Control and Automation Engineering at [IFSP-SJC (Federal Institute of the State of São Paulo - São José dos Campos)](https://sjc.ifsp.edu.br) and I'm due to graduate in 2027.
